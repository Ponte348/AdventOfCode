# Advent of Code

Inside each year's folder there's gonna what structures or strategies I used for each day.  
If I don't have anything it's because it was just a logical solution with a specific strategy.

  Started in 2023, will get back to it when I have time.

- **2022**
  Got to day 8, will get further in the future.

- **2023**
  Got to day 12, learnt some neat stuff, but I'm good for now.
